# Welcome
Cross platform application that works as a simpler TV Guide focused on the shows instead of the channels/platform.

## Why this app?
Many times, you just want to sit in front of your tv or any device and watch that game or the event you were waiting for, but you don't know where it was going to be broadcasted. Instead of zapping or going to the private guide of every channel you can remember at the moment, you can use your phone to select the event you wanna watch and see where it is going to be broadcasted.
